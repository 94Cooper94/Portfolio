Included in this repository is my (Cooper Ahearn) personal website.
The conglomerate of websites can be broken down into four individual sites.
Index.html, directly in the repository, includes the homepage.
The homepage navigates users to either the about-me or portfolio pages.
Within the aboutMe/ is the aboutMe.html, which is... about me.
This includes basic background information and some filler photos.
Within the portfolio/ is the portfolio.html which will include future projects.

Also nestled into my portfolio are links to my github, linkedin,
and an inner-reference to the contactMe page!
Within the contactMe/ is the contactMe.html containing a submission field.
Unfortunately the field isnt linked to javascript.
Fortunately, each page is tied together with a thoughtful and responsive navbar.
